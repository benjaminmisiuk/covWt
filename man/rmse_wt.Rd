\title{Weighted Root Mean Squared Error}
\usage{
rmse_wt(y, y_h, wt)

rmse(y, y_h)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector of true values.}

\item{y_h}{Vector of predicted values.}

\item{wt}{Vector of sample weights.}
}
\description{
Calculate weighted or unweighted root mean squared error.
}
\details{
Weighted RMSE is calculated by taking the root of the weighted MSE, as calualated using \code{mse_wt}.
}
\examples{
#generate random data
a <- runif(100, 0, 3)

#simulate a linear dependent covariate with noise
b <- a + rnorm(100)

#check unweighted RMSE
rmse(b, a)

#generate random vector of weights
wt = runif(100)

#return weighted MSE
rmse_wt(b, a, wt)
